# Welcome to ChassisPHP!

ChassisPHP, pronounced Cha-see P H P, is a PHP framework designed to support and simplify the development
of brouchure-type websites. We are an opensource project supported and developed by volunteers. If you find a
problem with ChassisPHP, or find functionality that is missing, please add it as an issue on the main project.
If you are so inclined, submit a pull request with the change or fix. We welcome YOUR help! The main project
is here: [https://github.com/ChassisPHP/ChassisPHP](https://github.com/ChassisPHP/ChassisPHP)

## Installing

We recommend that you install ChassisHPHP using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). The skeleton app is a great starting point fro getting up quickly. Assuming you have Composer installed and set up on your development box:

 * create a directory for your project
 * from the directory above your project directory, run:
```
    composer create-project -s dev chassisphp/chassisphp-skeleton [project directory name]
```
replace [project directory name] with the directory name of your project

 * you can run the site using PHP's built in server by:
     * change to the directory [project directory name]/public
     * run the command:
```
       php -S localhost:8080
```
 * visit the site in you browser by typing `localhost:8080` in the address bar
